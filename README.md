# react_gallery_app_project_7
 My Seventh FSJS TechDegree Project! 

What Does This App Do?
- Presents a gallery of photos, 24 of them to be exact based on the users search using the Flickr API.

Instructions for running:
1. In your terminal, navigate to the application's directory.
2. Run "npm install", to install the project's dependencies.
3. Make a new file within the root folder and name it "config.js".
4. Within this file, create a variable named "flickrAPIKey" and set it equal to your Flickr API Key as a string.
5. Export this file using "export default flickrAPIKey;"
6. Run NPM Start and your application should load in port: localhost:3000 if you don't have anything else running on that port.
7. Use the App!
